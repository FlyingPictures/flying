    "title": "Team Building Above the Ordinary",
    "paragraph": "Take your team somewhere no boardroom can reach. A private balloon flight over Teotihuacán breaks hierarchies, sparks conversation, and creates shared memories that outlast any team-building exercise. Flying Pictures handles every logistical detail so your only job is to enjoy the view alongside your colleagues — and maybe close that deal at 2,000 meters."
